# Responsive Flags

> Country flags were creating using responsive dimensions. While creating the projects, color and size details were obtained from wikipedia. The highest priority was that the flags were responsive. 


## What I Learned:

- Using pseudo elements for create clean structure
- The correct units were used to make the page sensitive to every resolution
- Usage of unicode symbols learned
- The implementation of the css cals command for calculating the aspect ratio has been learned.


## Possible Improvements

- Cleaner code
- More code comments can be added
- Formatting could be improved when viewing on certain devices/browsers
